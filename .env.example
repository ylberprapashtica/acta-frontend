# API URL Configuration (optional)
# For local development, the frontend auto-detects the backend URL based on hostname
# Set this only if you need to override the auto-detection (e.g., for production)
# VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Note: In production, you should set this to your actual backend URL
VITE_API_URL=https://api.yourdomain.com
